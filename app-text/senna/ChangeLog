*senna-1.1.4 (08 Sep 2009)

  08 Sep 2009; Hans de Graaff <graaff@gentoo.org> +senna-1.1.4.ebuild,
  +files/senna-1.1.4-extconf.patch, +metadata.xml:
  Initial import based on ebuild in the gentoojp overlay. This ebuilds needs
  a lot more work on the QA front if it ever goes anywhere official, but
  it's good enough for me to experiment a bit with it.
